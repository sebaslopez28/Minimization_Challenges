# Minimization_Challenges

In this set of challenges you will find fit problems, optimization problems and regularization problems. All in the
context of an Optimization course given by PhD Mrinal Sen. These challenges were solved in MatLab. Each challenge comes with its statemen in PDF and its solution in .m. 

The third one is particularly interesting.
